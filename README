pam_fprint is a PAM module which uses libfprint's fingerprint verification
functionality to implement a fingerprint-based login system.

Before you can use pam_fprint to login, you must have enrolled at least one
finger on the device that you wish to use (or a compatible one). Currently
the easiest way to do this is to use the "enroll" example program found
in the libfprint distribution. A more advanced enrollment utility will be
included in the pam_fprint distribution in the near future.

pam_fprint is alpha software and has deficiencies.

See the the homepage for PAM setup instructions and other notes.
